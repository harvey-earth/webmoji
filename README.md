# Webmoji

A simple web application that takes emojis in the path and tells you which emojis they are.
It can also be used to search for emojis.

I created this after a new emoji update came out that left a lot of people seeing empty boxes or question marks.
When running the application, copy these symbols and enter them at the end of the URL path where the service is running.
They will be translated to the proper emojis and show properly in a modern web browser.
Alternatively, search for emojis and copy/paste them to use in texts.
They may not show correctly on your device, but will work in text messages.

## To Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `go build .` to create the `webmoji` binary.
3. Run `./webmoji &` to run the app in the background.
4. Access the application from http://localhost:5000/
